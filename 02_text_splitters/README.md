## Text Splitters in LangChain

A Text Splitter breaks large documents into smaller, manageable chunks before:

*  generating embeddings

* storing in vector databases

* passing context to LLMs


## Some Common Text Splitters

1. [Recursive Character Text Splitter](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/integrations/splitters)

2. [HTML Header Text Splitter](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/integrations/splitters/split_html)

3. [Recursive JSON Splitter](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/integrations/splitters/recursive_json_splitter)
