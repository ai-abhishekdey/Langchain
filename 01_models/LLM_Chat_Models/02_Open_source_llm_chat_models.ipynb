Since the question is simple, they might be looking for a quick answer without extra details. But providing a bit more context could be helpful without overwhelming them.\n",

      "Also, confirming New Delhi's status as the capital since 1911 under British rule, and now for independent India, adds historical depth. It shows the answer is well-researched. But I'll keep it concise—no need for a history lesson unless they ask follow-ups. \n",
